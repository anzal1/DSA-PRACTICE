miminimum insertions and deletions to convert string1 to string2
shortest common supersequence
longest palindrome subsequence
lomgest repeating subsequence
space optimised LCS
printing LCS


Variation of LCS
1. miminimum deletions to make array sorted
2 maximum sum increasing subsequence
3. maximum length bitonic subsequence
4. building bridges in a graph
5.the longest chain
