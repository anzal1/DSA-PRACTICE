binary heap is always a complete binary tree.


Advantages of binary heap
stored as an array
easy to insert and delete
easy to find the minimum element
easy to find the maximum element
easy to find the kth smallest element
easy to find the kth largest element
easy to find the median element
easy to find the nth smallest element
easy to find the nth largest element
easy to find the nth smallest element in log(n) time
easy to find the nth largest element in log(n) time



how can these be found
left(i) = 2*i + 1
right(i) = 2*i + 2

parent(i) = (i-1)/2 (floor)

min heap
every node is less than or equal to its children

max heap
every node is greater than or equal to its children


internally we use an array to store the heap





Application of pq

Dijkstra Algorithm
prims Algorithm
huffman Algorithm
Heap sort
and also every place where a heap is used
